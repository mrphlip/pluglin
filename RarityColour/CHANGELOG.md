# 1.0.0
* Bumping version number up to full-release status, now that the mod has been tested by players other than myself.
* No actual changes in this release, just the version number change.

# 0.2.0
* Initial public release
* Re-colours buttons in: post-battle upgrades, most scenarios that offer you relics, shops, and for some reason the "what's currently in my deck" info popup.
