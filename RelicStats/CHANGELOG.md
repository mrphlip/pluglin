# 1.0.1

	* Added new relic Safety Pegulations to the "changes projectile behaviour" too-hard basket
	* Updated stats tracking for Orbert's Story for its modified behaviour
	* Updated tooltip for Recombombulator to show a regular black bomb icon
	* Hero's Backpack, Perfected Reactant and Perfect Forger did not require changes to work with the new version
	* Constricting Chains, Heavy Hand, Haglin's Satchel and Molten Gold do not have stat trackers to update
* Fixed a bug that was making the run summary relic tooltips also show up in the Encirclepedia run history section.

# 0.2.0

# 0.1.0
* Initial public release
* Keeps stats for how effective your relics are
* Mouse over the relics in-game or at the post-game summary to see the stats
* Stats are implemented for 129 of 184 relics
* 11 tricker ones are still todo, but I still want to implement them in a future version
* 44 are ones it doesn't really make sense to have stats for (eg the ones that just increase your max HP)
