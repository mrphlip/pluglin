# 0.1.0
* Initial public release
* Keeps stats for how effective your relics are
* Mouse over the relics in-game or at the post-game summary to see the stats
* Stats are implemented for 129 of 184 relics
* 11 tricker ones are still todo, but I still want to implement them in a future version
* 44 are ones it doesn't really make sense to have stats for (eg the ones that just increase your max HP)
